DOGU. Still working on the acronym. I imagine this is how the CATME people felt. 

## TO INSTALL:
First, make sure you have postgresql, node, npm, and python3 (and pip) installed. 

I'd recommened making a python virtual environment because they're cool and good, but it's your life. 

Then, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` and `npm install` from the base folder.

Then, just run `./install.sh` and you're done. You can run `./runServer.sh` whenever you want and everything will (eventually) come up and work.
